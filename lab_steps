Steps for lab 3:


-done in lock:generate RSA keys (for each party?) 
	./rsa-keygen -p pubkey -s seckey -n numbits -c ca (optional)




Lock
	Generate the AES key, encrypt it with the public key (unlock_pub) from -p flag 
	and sign it with the private key from r flag (lock_priv).  Everything is encrypted with 
	the AES key


	to lock: ./lock -d test1 -p unlock_pub -r lock_priv -v ca_pub_key


Unlock:
	The person who can unlock it, comes in and checks to make sure the manifest sign corresponds
	to the -p public key (lock_pub).  Then they decrypt the manifest file with their 
	private key(unlock_priv).  Then decrypt everything with the AES key.

	to unlock: ./unlock -d test1 -p lock_pub -r unlock_priv -v ca_pub_key
